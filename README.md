This is a work in progress and NOT fully functioning! I suggest to open the Live log file to monitor what's going as there's still some errors which fill that up quickly. If you don't know where that log file is, this script is NOT for you üòâ
I am not a developer and just started diving into Python.

What is it?
A midi remote script for Ableton Live 11 (!) for the Mackie C4 controller in PYthon 3.

Old Status:
1. Only had a compiled script from Leigh Hunt
2. Script was written for Live 8 (LOM)
3. Was obviously written in Py2
¬†

What we did last year:
  1. First I decompiled the scripts using an online converter, with mixed results.
  2. Jon did lots of stuff to that, fixed, commented, streamlined, adapted. 
  3. I then decompiled using a better online decompiler.
¬†

What I did in the last weeks:

  4. I‚Äôve been using Pycharm with proper syntax checking.
  5. Got a new LiveUtils version from the touchable guys, which seems to introduce lots of redundant stuff, but kind of works for now
  6. By hand did the Py2 -> Py3 conversion by looking at what was in the code that looked like Py2 and converted that the Py3 (stuff like utf, long int, xrange > range etc)
  7. Managed to decompile the new Live11/Py3 scripts by using uncomyple6 and using the resulting code as a reference (mainly the Mackie stuff). Not everything was decompiled successfully but most of it
	8. Worked and commented a lot in the code
¬†


New status:

What works:

			1. Script get detected in Live 11
			2. C4 is usable and shows parameter names, encoders can be used and pushing them sets default value (where existant)
			3. Track switching works, also parameter bank switching and device switching for device mode (works if not a grouped device). 
			4. (solved, works now) Parameter names do not get properly shortened.  
			5. "Sends" etc also work in track mode, BUT always shows 11 "Sends" event if there are less	
¬†

What doesn't work / ToDo:

    1. last device deletion causes error #1 https://github.com/markusschloesser/MackieC4_P3/issues/1
    2. Parameter values are not shown #3 https://github.com/markusschloesser/MackieC4_P3/issues/3
    3. for the other stuff, see "Issues" here
   

I am currently not able to fix more, because I don't know how :-). So any help is welcome! Also, I just started getting into Git / GitHub and Pycharm as well, so bear (üêª) with me, if I do something stupid and please correct me (constructively cos I'm sensitive ;-) )
I also uploaded the decompiled Ableton Live 11 / Python 3 remote scripts in a separate repository.
