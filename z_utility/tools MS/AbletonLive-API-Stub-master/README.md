Ableton Live API Stub
=====================

This is the **unofficial** repository of the Ableton Live API Stub.
You can checkout branches to switch to different Live versions.

The purpose of this stub is to be added as module/dependency to your
Python IDE like e.g. PyCharm. This gives you code completion and inline
documentation.

It does not contain any real functionality (only pass statements) and
is **not** intended to be included in a Remote Script or called from one
at runtime!

Currently available branches are:
- *Live_9.6*
- *Live_9.7*
- *master* - the latest version I generated

The stub is generated by the *generate-stub.py* script in this repository,
which uses the Live9.x.xml files generated by Hanz Petrocs *API_MakeDoc*
available at http://remotescripts.blogspot.de/p/support-files.html

===> NO support given, ONLY source files !

Please, enjoy.
